## Protein Domains Summary

Figure 2. Protein sequence alignment for FGF-4, FGF-5, and FGF-6 with heparin and FGFR-binding domains. Protein domains summarized from a previous FGF-6 functional study. 58 Alignment and heparin and FGFR-binding sites/regions (HBS and FGFR-BR, respectively) are shown for FGF-4, FGF-5, and FGF-6 proteins.
